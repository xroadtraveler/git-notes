# git-notes
Notes from a Git and Github class, for reference.

The class these notes were taken for is:
"The Git & Github Bootcamp" on Udemy, by Colt Steele.

The class had a heavy focus on using git bash rather than relying 
mostly on a GUI or on Github.  The notes are quite extensive
and cover the subject of Git and Github very thoroughly.
